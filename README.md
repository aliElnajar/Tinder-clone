# welcome!

### lets talk briefly about this project...

> first of all, part of the design is inspired by sonny sangha -he's an instructor/youtuber-.
> , surely i've changed some of the UI to what i see fitter but that's not it.

### things i have added to the project:

> i've used firebase for 2 main purposes (authentication/storing data)

1. Authentication and added error handling/loading state
2. Data fetched for cards/chats (whether getting messages or sending the new messages as new doc).
3. added a routes protector component to avoid accessing any pages without authentication.
4. added loading state for better UX

### libraries i've used in the project

- REACT-ROUTER
- Mui
- TinderCards and it needed react-spring web
